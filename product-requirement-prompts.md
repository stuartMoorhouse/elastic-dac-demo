# Product Requirement Prompts

This file contains the requirements for your project. Fill out each section with relevant details before running `/init` in Claude Code. Claude will use this information to generate your initial project structure and implementation.

## Objective

```
Create a demo environment for testing Elastic Security's Detection as Code functionality.


```

## What

```
Deploy the following resources using Terraform:

- One 8 GB RAM Elastic Cloud instance on GCP, Finland, with the name "elastic-cloud-production"
- One 8 GB RAM Elastic Cloud instance on GCP, Finland, with the name "elastic-cloud-development"
- One 8 GB RAM Elastic Cloud instance on GCP, Finland, with the name "elastic-cloud-local"
- One fork of the Elastic Cloud DAC repo https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules on the user's own GitHub 
- A clone of the DAC repo fork on the local machine 
- An Elastic GitHub integration on elastic-cloud-production that monitors the detection-rules fork


```

## Why

```
To test and demontrate a DAC workflow with Elastic's detection-rules

```

## Success criteria

```
This demo is only concerned with custom rules, so:

Use Git only for custom rules
In the newly create fork of detection-rules on the localmachine:
bash# Set up custom rules directory

python -m detection_rules custom-rules setup-config custom-rules
export CUSTOM_RULES_DIR=./custom-rules

## configure authentication from the users machine to the local cluster
Create a file in the root
of the repo called
.detection-rules-cfg.json
2. add the URL of the Local Elastic Cloud cluster to .env
3. Create and add an API key for the Local Elastic Cloud cluster to .env

# Your repo structure:
detection-rules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom-rules/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/        # ONLY your custom rules here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/    # CI/CD for custom rules only

In your CI/CD workflow:
yaml- name: Deploy Custom Rules Only
  run: |
    # This imports ONLY from custom-rules directory
    python -m detection_rules kibana import-rules \
      -d custom-rules/rules/ \
      --cloud-id ${{ secrets.CLOUD_ID }}


And I want to be able to demonstrate this workflow using the resources created here: 

## Elastic Security SIEM - Full CI/CD Pipeline
1. Local Development
bash
# Setup and create feature branch
git clone https://github.com/[your-org]/detection-rules.git
cd detection-rules
git checkout -b feature/suspicious-powershell-detection
Develop rule locally in Kibana:
Open your LOCAL Elastic cluster Kibana UI
Navigate to Security ‚Üí Rules
Click "Create new rule"
Write KQL query: process.name: "powershell.exe" and process.args: "-enc"
Test rule against sample data
Save and enable the rule
Note the rule ID
Export rule to feature branch:
bash
# Export from local Kibana (creates NDJSON)
python -m detection_rules kibana export-rules \
  --rule-id [RULE_ID] -d exports/

# Convert to TOML in repo (still in feature branch)
python -m detection_rules import-rules-to-repo \
  exports/[RULE_ID].ndjson

# Validate locally
python -m detection_rules validate-rule \
  rules/[directory]/[rule_name].toml

# Run tests locally
python -m detection_rules test
2. Version Control & Dev Deployment
bash
# Still in feature branch, commit changes
git add rules/
git commit -m "feat: Add suspicious PowerShell encoding detection"
git push origin feature/suspicious-powershell-detection
üöÄ GitHub Action triggers: Deploy to Development Kibana
Automated validation tests run
Rules deployed to Dev environment for testing
Team can review rule behavior in Dev
3. CI/CD Pipeline - PR to Main
bash
# Create Pull Request to main
gh pr create --title "Add suspicious PowerShell detection" \
  --body "Detects encoded PowerShell commands" \
  --label "detection-rule"
üîç GitHub Action triggers: PR validation workflow
KQL syntax validation
Schema compliance checks
Unit tests execution
Required peer review (1-2 approvers)
Dev test results attached to PR
4. Production Deployment
bash
# After PR approval, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --squash feature/suspicious-powershell-detection
git push origin main
üöÄ GitHub Action triggers: Deploy to Production Kibana
Final validation suite runs
Rules deployed to Production Kibana
Deployment notification sent to team
Automatic rollback on failure
5. Cleanup
bash
# Delete local feature branch
git branch -d feature/suspicious-powershell-detection
# Delete remote feature branch (usually auto-deleted after PR merge)
git push origin --delete feature/suspicious-powershell-detection

‚úÖ Best Practices Applied:
Detection Engineering
‚úÖ Test rules in isolated environment first (local ‚Üí dev ‚Üí prod)
‚úÖ Version control all detection logic as code
‚úÖ Peer review for quality assurance
‚úÖ Automated validation before deployment
DevOps/CI/CD
‚úÖ Feature branch strategy (not direct commits to main)
‚úÖ Automated testing at multiple stages
‚úÖ Progressive deployment (dev ‚Üí prod)
‚úÖ Squash merge for clean commit history
‚úÖ Rollback capability on failed deployments
GitHub Best Practices
‚úÖ Protected main branch (no direct pushes)
‚úÖ Required PR reviews before merge
‚úÖ Branch cleanup after merge
‚úÖ Semantic commit messages
‚úÖ PR labels for categorization
Security Considerations
‚úÖ Secrets stored in GitHub Secrets (not in code)
‚úÖ Least privilege access (dev vs prod credentials)
‚úÖ Audit trail via Git history
‚úÖ Automated rollback on validation failure

# Simplified CI/CD Best Practices for Detection as Code Demo

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branch (Production)
- Block direct pushes - only allow pull requests
- Require 1 code review before merge
- Require CI tests to pass
- Apply rules to everyone (including admins)

### Feature Branches (Development)
- Allow direct pushes for quick development
- No review requirements
- Basic validation only

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Required Checks
1. Syntax validation (lint detection rules)
2. Basic security scan
3. Rule format validation

## Terraform Implementation for Demo

### What You Need to Create

#### GitHub Provider Setup
- Configure GitHub provider with token authentication
- Set organization and repository name

#### Branch Protection Resources
```
Main branch protection:
- pattern = "main"
- require 1 pull request review
- require status checks: ["ci/lint", "ci/validation"]
- block direct pushes
- enforce for admins

Feature branches protection:
- allow direct pushes
- minimal status checks: ["ci/basic-lint"]
```

#### Repository Configuration
- Create repository with security features
- Set main as default branch
- Enable secret scanning

### Required Variables
- `github_token` (sensitive) - GitHub personal access token
- `github_organization` - Your GitHub username/org
- `repository_name` - Name for the detection rules repo

### Required Outputs
- Repository URL
- Branch protection summary

This simplified approach demonstrates the core concepts without complexity - perfect for showing how Infrastructure as Code can enforce security best practices for Detection as Code repositories.
